## Rules of the Game
Two players (the player and a CPU) are dealt there cards each and there is a deck of cards that both of them draw from. All six cards from both players are face-up while the deck remains face-down. Each player takes consecutive turns deciding which card will be chosen to compare with the one at the top of the deck. For example, if the player has cards with rank A, 7, and J, and they decide to choose the card with rank 7, they can choose if the card will be higher than, lower than, or equal to the card in the deck.  The first player that wins 10 points in total wins the game. If the deck is emptied before a victory, then it is shuffled. 

Additionally:
- Ace (A) = 1
- Jack (J) = 11
- Queen (Q) = 12
- King (K) = 13
